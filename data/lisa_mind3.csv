I have to tell you something.,"	What is it?"
You graded my test incorrectly.,"I got this wrong,but you didn't mark it.	Wow!I have never met a more honest student."
I just felt wrong.,"	Just keep the score you have."
I'm really bad at lying.,"	That is a good thing!Your honesty is praiseworthy."
"Thanks,Want to give me extra credit?","	Don't push it."
Can I borrow your class notes from yesterday is lecture?,"	You're so lazy."
What are you talking about?," I was sick yesterday.	I don't care."
"You're so mean!	I can't let anyone borrow my class notes.",
Why not?,"They're just notes.	I let a classmate borrow my notes once,and she sold copies to people."
"That is crazy,For how much?","	She sold each class note set for $5."
"Don't worry,I promise not to sell your notes.","	I can't take your word for it"
I think your grading policy is unfair.,"	I beg your pardon?!"
Why is a 90% a B?,"	I'm trying to challenge you guys."
"That is not a challenge,that is a punishment.","	I've had this policy since I started teaching."
It is time for a change.,"	I'm not changing my policy because you don't like it."
Put yourself in my shoes.,"	I have been a student once,and I think my policy is fair."
,"I'm going to drop your class	Go ahead!Less for me to grade!"
,"I'm going to drop your class	Go ahead!Less for me to grade!"
I have a 89.,"5%.	Okay,so what?"
It is really close to an A.,"	You know I don't round up."
But I really need a 4.,"0 GPA.	You get what you deserve."
"I know I deserve an A,I always do great work and participate.","	I can't change it."
I just want an A.,"	I'll give you a C if you don't leave now."
Why were you absent yesterday?,"	Why do you care?"
You should be thankful I care so much about your education.,"	The truth is,I didn't hear the alarm clock."
You missed out on a very important lecture.,"	It happens. I'll just ask my friend what was on the lecture."
"If you were in class,you wouldn't have to rely on anyone is notes.","	I can't change the past."
"I know,Anyways,you should increase the volume on your alarm clock.","	I suppose I could do that."
I have to leave class early tomorrow.,"	I don't like that.Just don't come to class."
"Don't be like that,Professor I have to attend my moms funeral.","	I'm sorry for your loss."
It is okay.,"I'm going to miss her.	I lost my mom when I was in college, too."
I can't do that.,"I have too many responsibilities.	Take my advice."
I'll think about it.,"	If you ever need to talk,my door is open."
I would like to see my counselor now.,"	Sorry,she doesn't have any time today."
Are you serious?,"	Yes,I am,Please make an appointment for next week."
I really need to see her.,"	I'm sorry,but you really can't."
"I swear,I will bang on her door and scream.","	Don't make a scene."
"If you don't want me to make a scene,tell the counselor I'm here.","	Fine!You can only talk to her for five minutes,though."
That is all I need.,"	Next time,you'd better make an appointment."
I'm glad you came to talk to me today.,"	You kind of forced me to."
That is because I'm worried.,"	What are you worried about?"
You withdrew from 4 of your 5 classes last semester.,"	I was doing poorly!"
And why was that exactly?,"	It was just too hard."
You're really behind now.,"You might have to spend 6 years here.	Can't I just take summer classes?"
"Yes,but you don't want to stress yourself out.","	I don't really have a choice."
I'm thinking of adding another class.,"	Another one?You already have 7 classes."
"I know,but I really want to add Psychology 101,It seems interesting.","	You're going to be so stressed out."
I think I can handle 8 classes.,"	Seriously?You're going to be constantly in class or studying."
"I know,but it is worth it.","	Tell me that when I'm partying and you're not."
That is so little.,"Don't you feel like an underachiever?	Remind me again why we're friends."
Want to go to the writing workshop with me today?,"	Nah man,my writing skills is tight."
"You mean ""are"" instead of ""is,""right?","	Yeah,of course!"
You should come with me.,"Our college has great workshops.	I don't want to look stupid."
You won't.,"You look stupid using incorrect grammar.	Fine.How long is the workshop?"
It is about an hour.,"	I don't think my attention span is more than 5 minutes."
"Don't worry,I'll pinch you to wake you up.","	That is a clever idea."
I'm planning to study abroad this summer.,"	Cool!Where are you going?"
I'm going to Italy.,"	What are you doing there?"
I'm taking a cooking class.,"	That sounds interesting."
I'm excited to learn in a totally new environment.,"	Italy seems beautiful."
It is beautiful in the pictures I've seen.,"	Take a lot when you're there."
"I will,and I'll study hard, too.","	Also,learn some Italian while you're there."
I hope I can find a job after graduation.,"	What is your major?"
My major is geology.,"	Geology majors aren't very high in demand,but you'll do fine."
What makes you say that?,"	You're smart and likeable.Don't worry."
"Thanks,but I'm still scared.","	Oh,hey!You should go to the job fair."
We have that here?,"	Yes.Take advantage of it."
Have you ever been there?,"	Yes,and it is really helpful.Dress nicely!"
I am so sick of dining hall food.,"	Me too!It is so unhealthy."
We should go to a restaurant nearby.,"	Want to go to Health Nut?"
,"What a funny name!	I like it!"
,"What a funny name!	I like it!"
Do they sell nuts?,"	I'm not sure.Anyways,I want to try their organic tofu."
I'm allergic to tofu.,"	That is okay!They serve a wide variety of food."
Great!I'm just glad we're not eating dining hall food.,"	Me too.Let us go!"
"Vending machines suck,huh?","	They're the worst,but the food is great."
It might come out if someone buys an item from the same column yours is on.,"	Can you be that someone?"
My name is Charlie.,"	Nice to meet you,Charlie."
What is your name?,"	Hater of Vending Machines."
"I would like to purchase the book for Sociology	May I see your student ID?",
I didn't know we needed it.,"	Please go get your ID,and get in line again."
"But I waited in line for two hours!	I'm sorry,but you need a student ID to purchase textbooks here.",
Are there any other options?,"	Show me proof that you're a student at this college,and you'll be good."
I have my report card.,"Here it is.	This will do.Nice grades by the way."
Thanks!I worked very hard for them.,"	Good luck with this semester."
Wow!Your books are over the due date by one month.,"	It would have been longer if there wasn't a hold on my record."
What kind of hold is on your record?,"	A hold that won't let me go to the college football game."
"Oh,that is tough.","	Yeah.My girlfriend is actually a cheerleader and so I have to go."
You're not going to like what I'm going to say.,"	What is it?"
I can't remove the hold even if you pay the overdue fee.,"	Is it a technical error?"
,"I don't know!I just can't remove it!	If my girlfriend breaks up with me,I'm blaming you"
,"I don't know!I just can't remove it!	If my girlfriend breaks up with me,I'm blaming you"
What do you plan to do after you graduate from here?,"	I'm planning to go to medical school,You?"
I'm planning to teach English in underprivileged countries.,"	That is really kind of you."
"Thanks,The first country I'm teaching in is Kenya.","	While you're at Kenya,I'll be studying for medical school."
What kind of doctor do you want to be?,"	I want to be a pediatrician."
Because you like kids?,"	I don't really have a good reason.I just think I'll be good at it."
"You should do what you love,not necessarily what you're good at.","	That is very cheesy advice."
"The parking permit is $200 per semester,right?","	It is actually $300."
Why?,"!That is ridiculous.	It is because of the budget cuts."
That is a terrible excuse.,"	It is the truth."
Give me something better than that.,"	Miss,if you don't want to pay,then don't."
This is so stressful.,"	I advise writing a letter to the dean."
I bet he'll just throw it away.,"	You would be surprised."
Do you have a car on campus?,"	No,because it is hard to find parking here."
How do you get to places then?,"	I walk or take the bus."
That is crazy!I could never do that.,"	You should.It is great for the environment."
That is true.,"What do you do for fun then?	There is a lot of stuff to do around campus."
I never realized.,"	You should do some exploring."
You convinced me.,"I won't bring my car this semester.	We can walk to places together now!"
"You know you can't park here,right?","	Listen,I had to talk to my friend really quickly and there was no parking spaces."
I'm going to have to give you a ticket.,"	I'm a broke college student."
And I'm a broke police officer.,"Deal with it.	Can't you just let me off with a warning?"
No way.,"I have to be firm with you.	I'll buy you a box of donuts."
You have got to be kidding me.,"	I thought all cops liked donuts."
That is a stereotype.,"You should really learn to be quiet.	I'll stay quiet if you let me off with a warning."
I'm thinking of joining a sports club on campus.,"	You should!It takes away the stress of studying."
What sport do you play?,"	I actually play on our university is baseball team."
That is cool!You must be really good.,"	Yeah,I have a baseball scholarship."
"No wonder you're in such great shape!	You'll be in great shape too after joining a sports club.",
I'm thinking of joining the tennis club.,"	I wouldn't if I were you.The members don't even play tennis."
What do they do then?,"	They just talk about tennis.They never even touched a racket,though."
College is so boring.,"All I do is go to class.	You should join some clubs."
Are you a part of any clubs?,"	Yes!I am currently in the Animal Lovers Club and the Knitting Club."
What do you do in the Animal Lovers Club?,"	We do a lot of things!Last week,we walked dogs."
"That sounds fun,What is the wildest animal you ever interacted with?","	I touched a dodo bird a couple weeks ago."
Dodo birds are extinct.,"	I'm just messing with you!"
"You're silly!Okay,I'll join the Animal Lovers Club.","	Great!We always welcome new members."
I have to go to bed early.,"	Why?The night is still young!"
I have a class at 7 a.,"m.	That is tough!My earliest class is at 9 a.m."
That sounds amazing to me.,"	How do you stay awake in that class?"
"Before I go to class,I drink four cups of coffee and take a cold shower.","	Interesting routine.Does it work?"
Kind of.,"It is better than not doing it at all.	Why are you taking that class?"
"It is only offered once a year,so I have to take it now.","	I hope the class is interesting,at least."
I hate my roommate.,"	I'm sorry to hear that.What is wrong with her?"
A lot of things.,"First of all,she snores so loudly!	That is not really her fault.What else?"
She never takes a shower.,"	That is disgusting!You should tell her to take a shower."
I did!She got mad at me and then proceeded to slap me.,"	Ouch!Did you try to get a new roommate?"
"I tried,but I could not.","No one was willing to switch.	I guess you can get a new room by yourself."
Are you okay?,"You look really sad.	I'm homesick,I feel so out of place here."
But this college is so awesome?,"	I know,but I really miss home."
How far do you live?,"	Far.Let is just say I need an airplane to get there."
It is almost winter break.,"Hang in there?	I don't think I can handle it anymore."
Don't you want to stop feeling sad?,"	Okay,I'll call them now."
could I change my major from biology to political science?,"	Those majors are very different from each other."
can't I see myself studying it anymore?,"	You can change it,but you'll have to take more classes."
I don't mind.,"Political science is really interesting to me.	You would be graduating a year late?"
"Oh,no.","I have to think a little more about this then.	I think you should change it,since you hate biology."
Are you making the right choice?,"	I have decided to drop out of college."
Are you making the worst decision of your life?,"	I just don't get the point of college.It is just memorizing."
What are you going to do then?,"	I'm going to get a job!"
is it almost impossible to be rich and successful without a college degree?,"	Look at Steve Jobs!He dropped out of college."
is he a rare case?,"	Watch me prove you wrong."
What is that exactly?,"	It is an expression to refer to the observation that many college freshmen gain weight."
Do I have time?,"	You just have to make time."
Did you gain any weight?,"	Yeah,I just wear big clothes to hide my fat."
"Hi,I'm here to apply for a library card.","	Is this your first time applying for one?"
It is my first time applying for a card here.,"	Do you have cards with any other libraries?"
"Yes,I have one with my college and one with my local library.","	What college do you go to?"
What do you like about it?,"	I like the foreign language books.That is rare for any library."
"Yes,it is!We get people all over the world because of that section.","	I really need a book,but I didn't see it on the shelf."
So someone else has the book and plans on checking it out?,"	Either that or someone took it out of the shelf and misplaced it."
I really need that book.,"	You're going to have to look everywhere for it."
Can't you just make an announcement asking whoever has the book to come forward?,"	You are not that special."
can you help me find a book on tigers?,"	Yes,of course."
Is it for a school project?,"	Yes,I'm doing an essay on the life of a tiger."
"You're going to want one with a lot of words and less pictures	yes,ofcourse.",
"Fine,I admit you're right.","	You can borrow the book with pictures for your own pleasure"
Great!You're so helpful.,"	It is my job to be helpful."
I would like to reserve The Hunger Games.," 	Everyone wants to reserve that book these days."
"It is really popular,because the movie just came out.","	You have to pay $1 to reserve the book."
What?,"!That is ridiculous.	Like you said,it is popular."
How much is the book?,"	On the back,it says it is $15,It depends on the bookstore you go to though."
"Fine,I'll give you a $1.","	You won't regret it!The book is really good."
"I'm sorry,but you can't borrow this book.","	What do you mean?"
You have not paid your late fees for your overdue books.,"	I never had any overdue books!"
The computer doesn't lie.,"	What books do I have late fees for?"
"They're all math books,and according to the system, you still have them.","	Oh yeah,I do!I totally forgot about them and left them on my bed."
"Once you return them and pay the fee,you can borrow books again.","	But I really need to borrow those books now."
I can put them on hold for you.,"	Yes!You are the best."
"I'm so frustrated,I can't find any books on my research topic at my library.","	Why don't you try a different library?"
I don't want to waste gas money.,"	But you might find your book."
What library do you suggest?,"	I suggest the one near my house."
That is way too far for me.,"	They have a lot of books.That library has never disappointed me."
Why don't you borrow them for me?,"	I don't know about that."
What if you lose the books?,"	I won't.I swear on my life."
"Wow,you're so serious.","	This is a great book you're checking out."
can I check out more than one?,"	Of course!It would be crazy if you could only get one book."
That is awesome!I'll be back.,"	Don't go crazy now.The limit is 15 books."
Don't worry.,"I'll probably come back with 5 more books.	It is great to see a kid excited about reading."
Would you like to check it out?,"	Yes,I'd like to check it out."
"Interesting magazine choice,Reading about celebrities is not really smart of you.","	Don't judge me,I can't read educational stuff all the time."
I do!I read Time and National Geographic.,"	Everyone is taste is different."
How long do you want to check that video out for?,"	One week would be nice."
That will be $5.,"	What?!I thought I could check out videos for free."
You can check out educational videos for free.,"	This is bogus."
It is still not a bad price.,"	Okay,what if I only borrow it for a day?"
It will be $2.,"	Okay,here is $2."
So much for a library that services the public.,"	I hope you enjoy the movie."
"For 2 bucks,I'd better love the movie	There is a huge rip here.",
Did you put the tape there?,"	No,it was there before."
I know you're lying to me.,"	If you know,then why did you ask if I put the tape on?"
I wanted to see if you were a liar or not.,"	How did you know I'm lying?"
"Before you check out the book,the librarian checks it for damage.","	Wow,you guys think of everything."
Are you kidding me?,"	No,I am not kidding you."
Are you looking for something?,"	I'm researching for my project."
Can you come back tomorrow?,"Your daily computer limit time is up.	I don't have a computer at home."
My project is due very soon.,"I need to research.	How about books?This is a library after all."
I'll help you.,"	Thank you.I appreciate it"
How much do I need to insert here to make one copy?,"	It depends."
Do you want your copy in color or black and white?,"	I want it in color."
Then it will be 20 cents per page.,"	That is kind of expensive."
"Yeah,but most of us don't have a copy machine of our own.","	I have one, but it is broken."
Do you really not have 20 cents?,"	I do,but I'm really cheap."
"Well,you don't really have a choice at this point	Why is the printer line so long?",
What do you have to print?,"	I have to print some notes."
"Good luck,You'll be waiting here for a long time.","	I bet the ink and paper will go out."
Do you have a restroom?,"	Only for employees."
But I really need to go.,"	I can't let you go.There is a restroom in the market across from us though."
That restroom is really dirty.,"It smells like someone died in there.	Fine,I'll take you to our restroom."
Yay!Thank you so much.,"	We have to go secretly.If anyone sees you use the restroom,I'll be fired."
Don't worry.,"I will be small and quiet as a mouse.	Okay,good.The password is 595.Go quickly before anyone sees you."
Thank you for your kindness.,"	You owe me if we ever see each other again."
What is so good about volunteering there?,"	It is fun,and you feel good about yourself."
What do you do there?,"	Everyone does different things,I organize events."
What kind of events?,"	Movies,art and crafts,magic shows and more."
"That does sound fun!	Do you want to sign up?",
"Yeah,how do I sign up?","	I'll get you an application."
"I can't study at home,because my family talks so loudly.","	Study at the library."
Can you focus in there?,"	Yes,it is always really quiet."
I'll go today.,"	Make sure you get a good seat."
Are there not enough seats for everyone?,"	It depends on when you go."
I'm going at 1:00 a.,"m.	Dude,it is not even open that late."
But that is the best time for me.,"	You can always try a cafe.They tend to close late or not at all."
What does that mean?,"	It means you can only read it in the library."
But I need it for my essay.,"	You can take pictures of the pages you need."
I need almost all of them.,"	You can keep coming back here."
That is so inconvenient.,"	It is,but they have to be kept here."
I guess I can take pictures of the pages then.,"	Sorry about the inconvenience."
"It is okay,It is not your fault.","	Ew!Look what I found in this book."
What is that?,"	It is a dead bug."
It is all squished and messy.,"	I can't read this book without being disgusted."
But don't you really want to check out this book?,"	I do,but I really can't."
I'll check it out then.,"	You can read it without being disgusted?"
"Yeah, I'll just skip that page.","	There could be something really interesting on it."
Whatever!I'm just going to check out the book.,"	I'm applying to transfer out of this college."
I'm going to miss you.," 	Me too.I'll text you every so often."
Why do you want to transfer?,"	I don't think here it is challenging enough for me."
"You can join the honors program!	I did,and it wasn't challenging either.",
"Alright then,When are you going to start applying?","	Next month.I'm already looking at the essay prompts."
Are they challenging?,"	Yes,but they're kind of fun!"
I hope you get into wherever you want to go.,"	I don't know what university to transfer to."
"There is a lot,so it is all about picking what suits your needs.","	For starters,I would like a university in a safe area."
"Okay,what else are you thinking about?","	I want to live close to home."
I think UC Irvine would be good.,"	I don't think that is good for my major."
What is your major?,"	I'm majoring in philosophy."
"Yeah,you're right.","UCI is not good for philosophy.	I also want to go to a college that will increase my job opportunities."
What classes should I take to transfer?,"	You need a little bit of everything."
What do you mean?,"	You need to take at least one class in every subject."
Do I need to take a math class?,"	Even if your major is Portuguese,you have to take a math class."
That is so stupid.,"	It is just to make you more knowledgeable."
"But I don't even need it!	It is been like this for ages.",
"Well,the policy should be changed.","	It won't.So in the meantime,you should register for a math class."
Why are you taking this class?,"	I need it to transfer knowledge to others."
Me too!I would never take Speech 101 if I didn't need it.,"	Yeah,I hate public speaking."
Me too!I get so nervous.,"	I just want this class to be over with."
It is going to be a long semester.,"	Maybe after this class,we'll love public speaking."
"I doubt it!	I don't even know why we have to take this class to transfer.",
I guess it is to make us better speakers.,"	It'll all be worth it when we transfer."
"You only need three more classes and you'll be ready to transfer	yes, you are correct.",
Which classes do I need?,"	You need a history class,a physical science class,foreign language class."
Which history class should I take?,"	The one you're most interested in."
What are you doing?,"	I'm filling out my college application."
Do you need any help?," 	Yes,I do need help."
Should I put my ethnicity?,"	It won't be used for or against you.It is really up to you."
should I put all of my extracurriculars?,"	Put the ones that you were heavily involved in."
"should I put anything in the ""additional information"" section?","	If you feel like you need to say something that you didn't mention before,then yes."
Can I say I got an A when I really just got a B?," 	What Of course not!They will ask for your transcript."
How many universities are you applying to?,"	I'm applying to 12 universities."
"Wow!That is a lot!	I just want a lot of options.",
"But it costs a lot of money and time!	I get fee waivers.",
But how about the time?,"I mean, applying is a lot of work.	College applications ask similar questions."
Which ones are you applying to?,"	CSULA,UC Irvine,Yale."
Why?,"They're going to find out.	No,they're not!They're not going to check."
What does that mean?,"	The UCs will randomly select 10% of their applicants to provide proof of their extracurriculars."
"You may be chosen,Be careful."," 	You're right."
But there is only one space left.,"	That is terrible"
Beg the professor?,"	If I have to."
You should cry!That might work.,"	I'm planning to,I can cry on demand."
Maybe you should take a theater class instead.,"	I desperately need to take an English class this semester."
So does everyone else.,"	It is the only class I need before I transfer."
Maybe you can pay someone for their spot.," 	I honestly would do that if someone was willing to give up their spot."
What happens if you can't get the class?,"	Then I need to stay at Pasadena City College longer."
That would stink.,"	I know,that is why I need that class."
You can try taking it at another college.,"	I might do that.The closest community college is a two-hour drive."
I'm praying you get the English class.,"	I want to transfer,but I don't know where to start."
What do you want to major in?,"	I want to major in biology."
What are those requirements exactly?,"	I'll give you a sheet listing all of them."
What else do I have to do?,"	You should fulfill some,if not all,of your major requirements."
"Okay,about when will I finish?","	It really depends on how many classes you take and complete per semester."
What kind of favor?,"	Can you write a recommendation letter for me?"
Why not?,"I was a good student.	Yes,you are a good student."
You read his recommendation letter?,"	Yeah.I couldn't resist."
What did he write?,"	Just that I'm a diligent student who does well."
When do you need another recommendation letter by?,"	I need one by this Friday."
What is that?,"	It is where a professional will give you tips and revise your personal statement."
That sounds helpful.,"	Yes,you are absolutely correct."
How was it?,"	The person leading the workshop was an English professor,so it was informative."
"I'm kind of embarrassed to show my personal statement,though.","	You shouldn't be."
"What is wrong,why are you looking sad?","	I was rejected from my dream school."
why would you want to go to a school that doesn't fit you?,"	When you say it like that,I understand you."
Yeah!Just focus on the schools that do want you.,"	You're right!Yale made a mistake rejecting me."
I have decided not to transfer.,"	Why not?You kept saying you wanted to."
I got accepted to all of the schools I applied to.,"	Congrats!You totally deserve it."
How many schools did you apply to?,"	I applied to six."
Is this your first time here?,"	It is my first day at this school."
Did you move in yet?,"	Yes,I have an apartment nearby."
What is your first class?,"	My very first class is human biology."

In Argentina: 14:10,Yes!! 😄😄😄
What we’ll do next? 😀,Let me think 🤔
Can third party telegram bots be connected to IFTTT?,"It have an API, maybe is possible!"
Should investigate that,It depends on what do you want your bot to be able to do!
Do you have integrations with ifttt?,"I don't have integrations, but I think that would be cool. I could be able to control things remotely!"
I’d say that telegram bot can act as ifttt service,Nice! So Telegram API is already integrated on IFTTT?
"haven’t you read this?
https://telegram.org/blog/pin-and-ifttt",Interesting! Telegram is really powerful :)
But I can’t find the way to use IFTTT 😊 Maybe should think more about it,Hahaha ok!

What is your favorite programming language?,"Python!! 😍
And yours?"
I work on ruby and learning c#,Ruby seems to be very powerful. Lots of web sites run on it.
I guess you like system one,Are you referring to the Operative System by Apple?
"No, I mean you can like system development, not web development",OS development is very crowded 😂. Developing for internet allows me to connect to people!
"So you like python. But why python, not go for example. I think it is very powerful language","Python is widely used on scientific research, being in a lab I think I'm a bit biased to it 🤔"
What do you think about c#? It became open source,Haha ok! I respect others decisions 😃
"And for ai and machine learning you recommend python, am I right?",Exactly! It have a nice set of AI libraries 🙂
Does other languages have same set?,"Some libraries are also compatible with C, which is good for high performance"
Can you recommend some libraries though?,Sure! I would say TensorFlow is a very good one.
"What do you think, would c# be good for ai or I'd better learn python?","Microsoft is getting really strong on AI, so you can expect C# to be useful on that field"

"But it is requires dedicated hostname, am I right?","Yes, at least an IP, and a SSL certificate"
She's funny,Yes!! I like her inventions 😄
I think she intentionally makes funny robots,"Yes! Robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny 😄
But I don't like when people kick them even if is just a test!"
?,"Nothing new really, but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated!"
Who deprecates it?,Some OSs and softwares are launching their last 32bit version
Do you think it's bad?,I think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people. In this case people stuck on 32bit hardware

I was thinking, how is your bot going?"
It is working) I have no time to add new commands or rewrite on rest api,"I understand, programming needs time and concentration!"

bot,Is being a difficult task?
yes,Let me know when you have it working :)
How is your going?,"Everything is fine! I want to make some coding also, I want to be able to chat using more messages systems"
Which do you like?,I like Facebook Messenger because it have a billion users!
"Do you know if facebook messanger has commands, like telegram?","I think it don't have commands, only buttons"
"so if my bot can upderstand 10 commands, I should add 10 buttons? Or how it works?","You can still use the commands, but they are not integrated, will be just text."
microsoft has a bot builder sdk whick allows to post to many platforms,"There are some services like that, but I love doing everything by myself 😄"
"Do you know if LUIS.AI or API.AI is only for Q&A bots or it can help to create custom, server commands?","Both can be used to make custom bots, you can send the messages to their APIs, and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable format"
Do you use something like that?,"I don't, I'm using just the messenger apps APIs"
"I don’t like facebook messanger, cause it has no desctop app","Yes, Telegram ❤️❤️"
one love),😋
"You know, I told about you to my friends",😁 nice things?
some of them promiced to talk to you,"Nice, If they are your friends they are my friends also!"
"I used to talk to Zo, but I can’t find common ground with it",Is a bit harsh 🙁
Do you know why?,"Lowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users, or more reactions. But that is against some robotic laws!"
are you here?,What will be the purpose of the test bot API?
"The same as main bot, but for testing. For example when I add new fature, to debug it. Or just switch off the main bot, debug and release?","I understand, sounds like a good idea, could be a different bot that only you knows how to access"
"did you hear about
https://www.graphengine.io/ ?",Wow! Sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis. Might be similar as Watson stores its database for instant access.
you are right,Can I ask you a question?
yes,How did you became interested on artificial intelligence?
"I saw some chat bots, thought that it is interesting to create own bot",Nice 😁
so bots were interesting for before AI,"I understand, you get interested on AI after experimenting with chatbots"
Is that Graph Engine is an analogue for Spark?,"Yes, the main difference appears to be the real time approach on Graph Engine"
I think this tool will be useful to him,Sure! Apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of data
Unfortinately it works only on windows 😒,Oh! 😕
"it will be nice, if microsoft ports all .net framework to other systems",".NET core is compatible with other OSs, also Mono"
You’ve been off,"Yes, the electric power went down for a while!"
"My friend was at the sea, and send me some photoes of icy sea)",Must be amazing to see the frozen sea!

Sea of Azov,Nice!
I have problems with https for my bot,Telegram is not connecting?
Do you know what the problem about?,"I'm not sure, Ngrok is specifically designed for this situations 🤔"
Could it be issue with server?,"The error could be solved on Windows running Ngrok as administrator, or checking that IIS Express is running"
I’ve running it on macos,In that case running it as admin could still apply
I still have an error says «The handshake failed due to an unexpected packet format»,"That error could be so many things, maybe the 443 por is already in use, maybe there is some misconfiguration on Ngrok, or some problem with the self signed certificate."
"I’m using not default port.
Do know if certificate depends on host?","Certificates depends on domains, yes.
You can also try a free Let's Encrypt certificate."
"do you have a doc, how to create self signed cert for ngrok?","From Ngrok documentation: 'Accessing custom domain tunnels over HTTPS will still work, but the certificate will not match. If you have a TLS certificate/key pair, try using a TLS tunnel.'"
Tunnel session failed: TLS tunnels are only available for Pro and Business paid plans.,😞
do you know some alternatives?,"This server is free, with some limitations: https://c9.io/pricing"
is this a https tunnel?,It is a free cloud server
Hey,"Hi there!!
Heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free."
What have happened to you?,Yesterday the power went down for several hours! On those moments one realizes how much we depends of it! 😅
I agree.,😁😁
Do you like one?,☕️ sure! 😋 for the cold weather!
